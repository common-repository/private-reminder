This plugin will show a reminder message when you view a private post.

== Description ==

This plugin will show a reminder message when you view a private post.
I wrote this little plugin for the IQ2 Theme, because I always post in private first, do some post-processing and then make the post public. And sometimes I forgot that a post was still private. This plugin helps you to remind.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the private-reminder folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings -> Private Reminder to edit the Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use it with every theme? =

Yes you can, but most themes have their own solution for it, when you view the post, the title is pre-fixed with "Private:". But the IQ2 theme I use, doesn't.
